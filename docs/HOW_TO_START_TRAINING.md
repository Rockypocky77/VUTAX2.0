# 🚀 How to Start AI Training - Super Easy!

## Just Double-Click This File:

### Windows (Easiest Way)
```
📁 Double-click: start_training.bat
```

### Any Platform
```bash
python start_training.py
```

## What Happens Automatically:

1. **🐳 Starts Docker services** (ML service + progress tracker)
2. **🤖 Begins AI training** for both models
3. **🌐 Opens dashboard** at http://localhost:5000
4. **📊 Shows real-time progress** with time remaining
5. **✅ Completes training** in 15-30 minutes

## You'll See This:

```
================================================================
                VUTAX 2.0 - AI TRAINING LAUNCHER
================================================================

🤖 This script will:
   1. Start the ML service for training
   2. Launch the training progress tracker
   3. Begin training all AI models
   4. Open the progress dashboard in your browser

⏱️  Expected training time: 15-30 minutes
📊 Progress tracking: http://localhost:5000
================================================================

Press Enter to start training...
```

## Training Progress Dashboard:

The script automatically opens **http://localhost:5000** where you can see:

- **📊 Real-time progress bars**
- **⏱️ Time remaining estimates**
- **📝 Live training logs**
- **📈 Model accuracy metrics**
- **🎯 Current training stage**

## Training Stages:

1. **📊 Collecting Data** (0-30%) - Fetching market data
2. **🔧 Feature Engineering** (30-50%) - Calculating indicators  
3. **🤖 Training Models** (50-80%) - Machine learning
4. **✅ Validation** (80-90%) - Testing accuracy
5. **🚀 Deployment** (90-100%) - Saving models

## That's It!

Just run the file and watch your AI models train themselves! 🎉

The training tracker Flask app (`app.py`) runs separately from the main website and shows you exactly how much time is left for the AI to finish training.
